Welcome to the MLAPI Community Wiki!

This is where you will find all the documentation for the MLAPI.




### Wiki Editing Guide
If you find anything you want to provide to the wiki, please do so. 
This wiki is built by the community, for the community. Below you can read
instructions on how to edit the wiki.

#### Changing Information
In the ``_docs`` folder is where the Markdown wiki files are located. To update information, update the content and submit a pullrequest.
#### Creating Pages
To create a page. Start out by creating the Markdown file in the ``_docs`` folder in the appropriate subfolder.
Secondly, add the file to the index by adding the following to the top of the file:
```yml
---
title: <Title>
permalink: /wiki/<Name>/
---
```

##### Example
Files should follow the following convention ``my-long-topic-name.md``
That would make the header:
```yml
---
title: My Long Topic Name
permalink: /wiki/my-long-topic-name/
---
```


The last step is to add it to the sidebar. This can be done by editing the ``docs.yml`` in the ``_data`` folder.
Simply add the part of the permalink after ``wiki``. The above examples entry in the ``docs.yml`` file would look like this


```yml
- title: Title Header Is Here
  docs:
  - my-long-topic-name
```
